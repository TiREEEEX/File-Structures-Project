You have to run this command in the terminal in order to run the program in your pc :

gcc main.c functions.c -o my_program

Notes:


The program is designed to work with 2 types of files :
  - TOVS : ( Table , Ordered, Variable-Sized Rec, Overlaped ) files
  - TnOVS : ( Table , not Ordered, Variable-Sized Rec, Overlaped ) files

Overlap = Struddle ( I used the two terms, but they are the same )
